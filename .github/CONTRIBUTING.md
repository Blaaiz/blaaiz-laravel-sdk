2. Clone your fork: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/blaaiz-laravel-sdk.git`
3. Install dependencies: `composer install`
4. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`

#### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
composer test

# Run specific test suites
vendor/bin/pest --filter="Unit"
vendor/bin/pest --filter="Integration"
vendor/bin/pest --filter="Feature"

# Run with coverage
vendor/bin/pest --coverage --min=80
```

#### Code Standards
